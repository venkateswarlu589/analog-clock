# Analog Clock

# An analog clock is a traditional timekeeping device that displays the current time using hour, minute, and sometimes second hands, arranged on a circular dial. Here's a detailed description of the typical features of an analog clock:

# Dial or Clock Face: The clock face is a circular surface that serves as the background for the time display. It is typically marked with 12 numerals representing the hours, and smaller markers or divisions indicating the minutes.

# Hour Hand: The hour hand is a shorter hand that points to the current hour on the clock face. It moves at a slower pace than the minute hand.

# Minute Hand: The longer hand is the minute hand, pointing to the minutes on the clock face. It moves more quickly than the hour hand.

# Second Hand (optional): Some analog clocks have a second hand, a slender hand that moves around the clock face, pointing to the seconds. Not all analog clocks have a second hand.
