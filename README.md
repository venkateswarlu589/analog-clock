# Analog Clock

# An analog clock is a traditional timekeeping device that displays the current time using hour, minute, and sometimes second hands, arranged on a circular dial. Here's a detailed description of the typical features of an analog clock:

1) Dial or Clock Face: The clock face is a circular surface that serves as the background for the time display. It is typically marked with 12 numerals representing the hours, and smaller markers or divisions indicating the minutes.

2) Hour Hand: The hour hand is a shorter hand that points to the current hour on the clock face. It moves at a slower pace than the minute hand.

3) Minute Hand: The longer hand is the minute hand, pointing to the minutes on the clock face. It moves more quickly than the hour hand.

4) Second Hand (optional): Some analog clocks have a second hand, a slender hand that moves around the clock face, pointing to the seconds. Not all analog clocks have a second hand.
